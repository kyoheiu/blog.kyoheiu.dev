  <p>I recently jumped into Netlify-hosted from other server. This article is about how to use Google Domains with Netlify (and why GitLab pages with custom domain is <em>bad</em>).</p>
<p>First of all, Options of hosting service I had in mind were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firebase</li>
<li>GitLab pages</li>
<li>Netlify</li>
</ul>
<p>Firebase seemed good for dynamic site, but this site is powered by Zola (a fantastic static site generator) so, well, I don't use it for now.</p>
<p>Next, GitLab pages. OK I use GitLab for my main repository-hosting service, and it's been great. So I thought GitLab pages with custom domain was natural and might be easy.</p>
<p>It was not. Using custom domain in GitLab pages is hard. I do not recommend this setup.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>Because its document is broken.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/custom_domains_ssl_tls_certification/">official tutorial</a>, they say &quot;set the A record to foo, and TXT record to bar.&quot; But in the settings page of custom domain, I'm told to set CNAME and TXT. What's going on?</p>
<p>Actually I tried both. Neither did work. Though time might solve this (due to TTL? Note that I've waited for 1 day), I felt like, OK this is enough.</p>
<h3 id="resource-records-for-netlify">resource records for Netlify</h3>
<p>So, I went to Netlify, which I've used as an example site for my Zola theme. In <code>DNS &gt;&gt; resource records</code> set as following and, voila, it's done:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">name</th><th align="left">type</th><th align="left">TTL</th><th align="left">data</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="left">@</td><td align="left">A</td><td align="left">10m(or whatever you like)</td><td align="left">75.2.60.5</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">www</td><td align="left">CNAME</td><td align="left">same as above</td><td align="left">YOURSITENAME.netlify.app.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Netlify automatically set the TLS certificate with Let's Encrypt a few minutes after check for DNS configuration. This was a good experience, so I highly recommend Netlify over GitLab pages, at least for now.</p>
