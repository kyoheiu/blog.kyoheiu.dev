### fm v0.2.0

[kyoheiu/fm](https://github.com/kyoheiu/fm)

A simple TUI file manager with vim-like keybind, written in Rust.

- Linux : works well
- MacOS : _should_ work, though some unusual errors may occur
- Windows: almost unavailable due to file-name encoding error

My aim is to make a file manager that enables you to:

- configurate easily
- do what you want in daily use

And with `fm`, now you can:

- set your own commands to open file inside this program with `config.toml`
- delete, yank & put multiple items
- filter the list and choose item easily
- toggle sort order
- rename item
- empty the trash directory
- execute shell command in shell mode

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/kyoheiu/fm.git
cd fm
cargo +nightly install --path .
```

### Usage

| command               |                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fm`                  | Show items in the current directory.                          |
| `fm <directory path>` | Show items in the path. Both relative and absolute available. |

| y                     | Yank item. If you yanked other item before, its information is replaced by this one.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| p                     | Put yanked item(s) in the current directory. If item with same name exists, copied item will be renamed with the suffix "\copied".                                                                                                                     |

| y (select mode)       | Yank selected items, and return to normal mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Ctrl+c                | Copy item name to clipboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| t                     | Toggle sort order (by name <-> by modified time). This change remains until the program ends (sort order will be restored as configured).                                                                                                               |
| :                     | Switch to shell mode. Type command and press Enter to execute it (e.g., `:cd ~` means to change directory to home dir and to refresh the list). You can use any command in the displayed directory, though the list may be broken during the execution. |
| c                     | Switch to rename mode (enter new name and press Enter to rename the item).                                                                                                                                                                              |

| E                     | Empty the trash directory. **Please think twice before using this command.**                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Esc                   | Return to normal mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :q / ZZ               | Exit the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| H                     | Show help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Note that items moved to the trash directory are prefixed with Unix time (like `1633843993`) to avoid name conflict. This prefix will be removed when paste.

### Configuration

|                 |                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| config file     | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fm/config.toml` |
| trash directory | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fm/trash`       |

Default config file will be created automatically when you launch the program for the first time.

In config.toml, you can configurate:

- color of directory, file, and symlink separatively
- default key for sorting item list ("Name" or "Time")
- how to open files

#### Command configuration

If you write

```
default = "nvim"

[exec]
feh = ["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "gif", "svg"]
zathura = ["pdf"]
```

then, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif and .svg files are opened by `feh <file-name>`, .pdf files by `zathura <file-name>` and others by `nvim <file-name>` .
